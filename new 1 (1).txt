CHIEF COMPLAINT
Routine follow up of chronic medical conditions. 


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
Mr. Quinn Truitt is a 61-year-old male who presents today for a routine follow-up of his chronic medical conditions.
Today, the patient reports feeling more fatigued as of late. He notes that he usually rides his bike for about 20 to 30 miles and by the end of his ride he is tired enough that he will immediately fall asleep. The patient adds that he can fall asleep easily and gets about 6 or 7 hours of sleep per night. He believes he snores a bit but denies any signs of apnea.
Of note, the patient underwent an aortic valve replacement and ascending aortic aneurysm repair on 01/22/2013. As he is now 8 years post-op, he has requested an echocardiogram from Dr. Nicholson to review how he is doing currently. His last stress test was performed on 09/09/2019.
Mr. Truitt reports that his wife and friends have told him that he has pursed lips when he walks. This has also been noticed by his other providers. He denies any wheezing.
Furthermore, the patient has noticed a 2 to 3 mm nodule in his right testicle, possibly with the epididymis but he is unsure. He has not had a vasectomy. 
His current medication list only consists of clindamycin prior to dental procedures and vitamin D3 (50,000 IU on Sundays and 2000 IU the other 6 days). 
From a preventative standpoint, the patient is due for the shingles vaccine and an MMR titer. He is fully vaccinated for COVID-19 with his first dose on 01/15/2021 and his second dose on 02/05/2021.

RESULTS
Regarding his blood work from 04/10/2021, the patient's alkaline phosphatase was elevated at 156. His lipid panel showed elevated total cholesterol of 247, HDL 66, LDL 166, and triglycerides 74. The patient's TSH was normal at 2.68. His CBC was unremarkable. His most recent vitamin D level was at the high end of normal at 94.


ASSESSMENT
• History of aortic aneurysm repair. 
• Elevated alkaline phosphate level. 
• Lung field abnormal finding on examination.
• Right testicular nodule. 
• Preventative health. 


PLAN
Mr. Quinn Truitt is a 61-year-old male who presents today for a routine follow-up of his chronic medical conditions. 

History of aortic aneurysm repair.
- Overall, he is doing well and currently asymptomatic. 
- Currently he is not seen by cardiology routinely and I have suggested he follow up with Dr. Sun Harvey. 
- Ordered echocardiogram and stress test. 

Elevated alkaline phosphate level. 
- Most recent CMP showed elevation at 156 IU/L.
- This could be related to his liver but most likely related to his bone health. 
- Ordered an alkaline phosphatase and gamma GT. 

Lung field abnormal finding on examination.
- The patient has been noted to purse his lips while breathing. 
- He had found himself feeling more fatigued at the end of the day. 
- He does cycle 20 to 30 miles at a time. 
- His exhalation phase was low on exam. 
- Ordered pulmonary function testing for further evaluation. 

Right testicular nodule.
- 2 to 3 mm nodule noted on exam. There is no palpable hernia. 
- Referral placed to urology for possible ultrasound. 

Preventative health.
- Most recent blood work reviewed with no significant abnormalities. 
- He is fully vaccinated against COVID-19.
- Recommend shingles vaccine next month. 
- MMR titer performed today. 


INSTRUCTIONS
- Return in 1 year for routine wellness visit, sooner if needed. 
- Call with any questions or concerns.
